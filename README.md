# DataStreams from Multiple APIs

This is the latest entry in my Learning Journey. and it is not expected to be useful to the world at large. However, my LinkedIn post discusses some speed bumps that I encountered that might be interesting for others just learning about web API "flavors." There is also a separate LI post about deploying to Virtual Applications within an Azure Web App that could be helpful to someone.

In broad terms, this project consists of a GUI which enables the user to access several different types of APIs. The original concept was to see if there were any speed differences among them (spoiler alert: not really). For a more detailed description, please see my LI post which covers this project [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7166539438662094848/). The other LI post I mentioned, covering deployment, is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7166542662341242881/).

As with the other Learning Journey repos, this project is running on Azure, and can be found [here](https://datastreamsapp.azurewebsites.net/).
